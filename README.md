# Important Notice
If you are reading this and are willing to offer relocation to european country to a developer of this application I would be very interested. 
You will get an extremely grateful and dedicated c++ developer working for you.

Due to my country's invasion of Ukraine both my future and stability of the service cannot be certain.
I've made some inroads about people maybe keeping my work alive so, if the worst comes to pass, ask the maintainer of https://www.ficlab.com/ whether the backup can be put up and how soon. 

P.S. It's been a fun run, but I feel like I am just going to vanish soon, First from the internet and from this world soon after. 
(this is not a suicide notice, the timeframe covered mostly means Russia's likely disconnection from the internet)
